# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


Note if there is an error running this you may need to also run this first : 
### `npm install`
Eg "'react-scripts' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."

This will install the `node_modules` folder

____________

To clarify for both of the above you will probably need to have the following:
- Node.js
- npm
- React
- etc.

____________

### `.\node_modules\.bin\cypress open`

Runs and opens the "Cypress" application to be used for testing.
Note the React app already needs to be running.
- Click on "testing_test.tx" in the separate UI that opens to run the Test Cases
